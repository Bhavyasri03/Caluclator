### README for the Calculator Web App

#### Project Title:
**Learning the Calculator**

#### Description:
This project is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal input. The user can enter numbers and perform calculations in a simple and interactive interface.

#### Features:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Clear Button**: Clears the input field to reset the calculation.
- **Display**: Shows the result of the entered expression.
- **Decimal Support**: Allows entering decimal numbers.
- **Simple User Interface**: The calculator buttons and display are styled for an easy user experience.

#### Installation:
1. Clone or download the repository containing the HTML file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

#### Files Included:
- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure and JavaScript functions to handle the calculator's logic.
- `style.css` (Optional, if you want to separate CSS into a different file) - Contains styles for the calculator's layout.

#### Functionality:
- **Clear**: The `Clear()` function resets the input field when the "C" button is pressed.
- **Display**: The `display(val)` function appends the number or operator to the input field when the corresponding button is clicked.
- **Evaluate**: The `equate()` function evaluates the expression entered into the input field and displays the result. It uses the `eval()` function to perform calculations.

#### Usage:
- Enter numbers and arithmetic operators in the input field.
- Click on the "=" button to see the result of the calculation.
- Press the "C" button to clear the input field.

#### License:
This project is intended for learning purposes and is free to use or modify.

#### Future Improvements:
- Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, percentage).
- Improve error handling for invalid inputs or calculations.
- Add a history feature to keep track of previous calculations.
